Add your answer to problem 3 below.

In the second video, Chew Choon Keat emphasizes
testing and being able to write high level description
a desired result in english or in code. For changing
requirements he talks about using version control
In the first video, he talks about FOMO and how that
fear can affect from things like focus to blood flow.
He uses an example of a cat and how to use motivation
to overpower FOMO. One of the main takeaways I had was
that he emhpasizes on how people who
are motivated to learn and grow rather than people
who just want to make money, which I agree with a lot.
